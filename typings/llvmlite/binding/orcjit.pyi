    Create a library for linking by OrcJIT

    OrcJIT operates like a linker: a number of compilation units and
    dependencies are collected together and linked into a single dynamic library
    that can export functions to other libraries or to be consumed directly as
    entry points into JITted code. The native OrcJIT has a lot of memory
    management complications so this API is designed to work well with Python's
    garbage collection.

    The creation of a new library is a bit like a linker command line where
    compilation units, mostly as LLVM IR, and previously constructed libraries
    are linked together, then loaded into memory, and the addresses of exported
    symbols are extracted. Any static initializers are run and the exported
    addresses and a resource tracker is produced. As long as the resource
    tracker is referenced somewhere in Python, the exported addresses will be
    valid. Once the resource tracker is garbage collected, the static
    destructors will run and library will be unloaded from memory.
